Apple Watch does not show you notifications of a third-party incoming call.
(For example: LINE, WhatsApp, Skype, WeChat, ...etc)

**CallSlicer enables you to receive a third-party incoming call on your Apple Watch!**

(The reason why Apple Watch does not is these apps use Apple's API *CallKit* that integrates the third-party calling apps into the iOS, but Apple Watch doesn't support CallKit.)

<br>

**YOU NEED A JAILBROKEN IPHONE!**

Jailbreaking is a dangerous process.
I take NO RESPONSIBILITY, if something goes wrong.
