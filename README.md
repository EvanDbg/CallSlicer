## About

Apple Watch does not show you notifications of LINE call.

**CallSlicer enables you to receive LINE call on your Apple Watch!**


(The reason why Apple Watch does not is LINE uses Apple's API *CallKit* that integrates the third-party calling apps into the iOS, but Apple Watch doesn't support CallKit.)
